# Python_libplctag_GUI
Simple GUI app for the [libplctag](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag) python wrapper. 

Currently functional for reading atomic types and their arrays, bits, strings, timers, counters, controls from different PLCs and getting tags from ControlLogix PLC.

Intended to be used solely as a testing tool (not fit for any production environment).

Make sure to check the pictures in the "screenshots" folder on how to setup the folder structure, each folder with its own library file inside:
- the required folder structure for Multi OS
- the optional expanded folder structure to include Android as well
- or just create a single folder for the Operating System you will be using (Single OS)

Get the libplctag libraries and python wrapper files here:

- libplctag library [releases](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag/releases)
  - use v2.1.22 to be able to use MicroLogix PID
  - otherwise use the latest, which is or was v2.3.4+
- libplctag's python wrapper [py](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag/tree/release/src/wrappers/python/plctag) files
  - modified [libplctag.py](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag/issues/228) file in case the above is not updated

Android libraries, if you might need them, you can get from my [Android_Phone_Test](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/Android_Phone_Test) project or build them yourself by cloning the [libplctag4android](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag4android) project. Also check [libplctag4j](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag4j/releases) releases.

# Functionality
- Generally designed to display a single value per tag entered, either of string / integer / float ... etc.
- Multiple consecutive elements / bits can be displayed for certain data types by adding `{x}` at the end of the tag, where "x" is the number of elements/bits:
  - example `CT_STRINGArray[0]{5}` or `CT_DINT/2{15}` or `N7:0{3}`
- Displaying bits/PID/Timer/Counter/Control subelement values:
  - enter your tag
  - select bit/subelement from available list box (instead of entering it yourself)
  - optionally add `{x}` at the end
- Tag status label turns red/green to indicate failure/success in communicating with the PLC. 
- The default values can be changed for the app's startup, check declarations in the top section of the file.
- The app provides automated READ and doesn't include WRITE functionality.
- The "Get Tags" button will fetch ControlLogix tags and double-clicking any of the fetched tags will copy it to the clipboard.
- The IP Address, Path and Tag text boxes offer right-click "Paste" functionality.
- The Custom String Length has to be specified when the "custom string" data type is selected.
- Listbox selections are achieved with double-click.
- Modbus functionality of the libplctag library is not included in this app.

There might be bugs in the app. Not everything could be tested by me, since I don't have access to all the different PLCs supported by the libplctag library.
Check the libplctag website for all PLCs supported by the library.

# Usage

All it takes is to:

- Install python on your device (this was tested with v3.6.8 and v2.7.18).
- Create the required folder structure inside a folder of your choice and then:
  - copy the corresponding libplctag libraries to their folders
  - get wrapper files
  - download `plctag_gui.py` file from this repository and add it to your folder.
- One way to run it would be from the command prompt / terminal, by navigating to your folder and running the file with one of the following commands:
  - `python plctag_gui.py` or `python3 plctag_gui.py`
  - `python -m plctag_gui` or `python3 -m plctag_gui`
